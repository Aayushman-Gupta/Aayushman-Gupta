### üöÄ Projects

#### **Mela Safe** | Real-Time Stampede Prevention System
* **Tech Stack:** Django, React, C++, Python, NumPy
* **Description:** Designed a system to handle 100,000+ individuals by integrating pathfinding algorithms and an LSTM model for crowd movement prediction. The system achieved over 90% temporal accuracy in predicting congestion zones and reduced potential congestion by up to 40% in simulations.

#### **Multithreaded Stock Price Simulator** | C++, Concurrency
* **Tech Stack:** C++, Concurrency, Producer-Consumer
* **Description:** Spearheaded a producer-consumer based simulator where multiple threads generate and process live stock price updates in real-time. The system was architected with a thread-safe queue, achieving 100% race-free execution and a 40% performance improvement over naive synchronization methods.

#### **TrainMe** | Full-Stack Course Selling Platform
* **Tech Stack:** React, Django, PostgreSQL
* **Description:** Developed a scalable platform supporting over 1000 concurrent users. Implemented real-time filtering and keyword-based search that improved course discovery by 60%, and managed over 10K user-course records with a normalized database schema.
